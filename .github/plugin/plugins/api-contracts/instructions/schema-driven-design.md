# Schema-Driven Design Standard

## Scope

This standard applies to boundary contracts, serialized data, configuration,
messages, persisted records, tool inputs, API payloads, manifests, hook
metadata, plugin catalogs, and any intermediate representation that crosses a
module, process, storage, or human-authored file boundary.

For any content stored as structured data, a schema-driven workflow is
mandatory. There are no exceptions for "small" JSON, TOML, YAML, generated
manifests, plugin metadata, hook adapters, fixtures, or local ledgers. If the
repo persists structured data, the accepted shape must be owned by a schema,
typed parser, generated model, or equivalent boundary assertion, and the change
must have a validation path.

Inside the program, use type-system constructs as the internal authority. At the
boundary, use schemas, parsers, generated models, or equivalent assertions as
the external authority. The goal is the same in both places: move as much
certainty as possible into statically inspectable structure so illegal states
cannot be represented.

Schema and language representations live beside this file. JSON Schema examples
are in `json/`; Kotlin boundary representations are in `kotlin/`.

## Quick Use

1. Identify the boundary where untrusted or serialized data enters.
2. Make the accepted shape explicit in a schema, parser, constructor, generated
   type, or equivalent boundary assertion.
3. Reject unknown, incomplete, impossible, or ambiguous states at that boundary.
4. Parse into a stronger typed representation before business logic sees the
   value.
5. Keep descriptions, defaults, variants, examples, and compatibility notes with
   the boundary model.
6. For stored structured data, identify the schema or validator before editing
   the data and run that validation before calling the change complete.

## Reference Map

- `json/lifecycle-events.schema.json`: closed discriminated variants and named
  constrained primitives in JSON Schema.
- `kotlin/boundary-assertion.kt`: parsing an external payload into typed domain
  values and sealed variants.

## Conflict Handling

If a local producer, fixture, handler, or documentation page disagrees with the
schema, treat the boundary assertion as the authority until stronger current
evidence proves the schema is stale. Do not broaden a schema to match incidental
bad data without naming the compatibility impact.

## Principle 1: Boundary assertions are the first authority

Every external value enters through an explicit boundary assertion. The
assertion must define what is accepted, what is rejected, and what typed value is
produced.

Do not treat parser code, prose, examples, fixture names, downstream
conditionals, or known producer behavior as the contract. The schema or boundary
type is the contract; all other code conforms to it.

**Rule:** Before a value becomes domain data, it must pass through a named
schema, parser, constructor, or factory whose accepted shape is statically
inspectable.

---

## Principle 2: Assert aggressively at the edge

Boundary assertions should be narrow by default:

- require all fields that the domain requires;
- reject unknown fields unless extension is intentional;
- use finite variants for finite concepts;
- encode string formats, numeric bounds, collection cardinality, and nullability;
- distinguish absence from emptiness, emptiness from blankness, and blankness
  from invalid syntax when the domain cares.

Weak schemas create downstream uncertainty. A permissive boundary is a promise
that every consumer must re-check the same facts later.

**Rule:** If downstream code needs to ask whether a boundary value is shaped
correctly, the boundary assertion is incomplete.

---

## Principle 3: Make illegal states unrepresentable in data

Use schema structure to eliminate invalid states before runtime logic sees them.
For finite families, model each legal variant as a closed object and compose the
family with a discriminated union. For primitive domains, wrap raw values in
named constrained definitions instead of passing bare strings, numbers,
booleans, or maps.

**Rule:** A schema that permits a meaningless combination is not a source of
truth; it is an untyped transport envelope.

---

## Principle 4: Static analysis should see the model

Prefer data structures that tools can inspect over imperative checks hidden in
handlers. A reviewer, generator, linter, migration tool, or test harness should
be able to answer core questions from the model:

- Which variants exist?
- Which fields are required?
- Which fields are nullable?
- Which values are bounded, formatted, or enumerated?
- Which objects are closed?
- Which schema owns each reusable domain concept?
- Which changes are compatible or breaking?

Runtime validation is necessary, but it is not enough. The contract must also be
analyzable without executing business logic.

**Rule:** If a meaningful invariant exists only inside an `if` statement in a
handler, move it into a schema, type, constructor, or generated contract
artifact.

---

## Principle 5: Parse into typed structure, never validated blobs

Validation must produce a stronger representation. After a boundary assertion,
the program should hold domain values, sealed variants, branded primitives,
value classes, generated typed records, or an equivalent language-native model.

Avoid designs where validation returns the same untyped JSON object, dictionary,
or string-keyed map and trusts later code to remember what was proven.

**Rule:** The result of boundary validation should make repeated validation
unnecessary and make invalid states difficult or impossible to express.

---

## Principle 6: The schema owns boundary metadata

Descriptions, examples, defaults, deprecation status, discriminator values,
formats, and compatibility notes belong with the schema or the generated type.
Do not keep a parallel catalog connected by string keys unless registration is
enforced at the definition site.

**Rule:** If adding or renaming a field requires editing a schema, parser,
documentation table, fixture registry, and handler by hand, the model is too
detached. Pull the metadata back to the authoritative boundary definition.

---

## Principle 7: Evolution is part of the model

A schema-driven system must make change shape visible:

- adding an optional field is usually compatible;
- adding a union variant is compatible only when consumers have exhaustive or
  fallback behavior by contract;
- changing a discriminator value is breaking;
- making an optional field required is breaking;
- widening or narrowing a constraint is a domain decision, not a formatting edit;
- changing meaning without changing identity is breaking even when validation
  still passes.

**Rule:** Version, migrate, or create a new variant when the meaning changes. Do
not preserve a schema name while silently changing the state space it represents.

## Anti-patterns to reject

| # | Anti-pattern | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Permissive object schemas with unbounded extension | Close the object or model a typed extension point |
| 2 | Raw strings for domain identifiers, statuses, or modes | Define named constrained primitives or enums |
| 3 | Untyped dictionaries after validation | Parse into generated or hand-authored typed structures |
| 4 | Prose-only invariants | Move the invariant into schema, constructor, or type structure |
| 5 | One schema that accepts every lifecycle state | Split legal states into variants with required fields per state |
| 6 | Fixture-derived schemas left as final contracts | Replace incidental sample shape with explicit domain constraints |
| 7 | Runtime-only assertions in handlers | Promote the assertion to the boundary model |

---

## Self-Audit

Before accepting a schema or boundary model, verify:

- Can the schema represent a state the domain says is impossible?
- Are all required domain facts required by the boundary assertion?
- Are all finite concepts modeled as enums or discriminated variants?
- Are objects closed unless extension is intentional and documented?
- Are raw primitives replaced with named constrained definitions where misuse is
  possible?
- Does validation produce a typed representation instead of a validated blob?
- Can static tools inspect the variants, required fields, nullability, and
  compatibility impact?
- Do invalid fixtures exist for missing required fields, wrong discriminators,
  extra properties, malformed primitives, and impossible state combinations?
