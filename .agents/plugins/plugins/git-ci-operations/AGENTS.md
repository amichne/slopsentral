# Git CI Operations Plugin Instructions

## Scope

This generated adapter applies to the `git-ci-operations` plugin payload. Do not edit it directly; update the provider-neutral primitives or plugin manifest, then regenerate the marketplace output.

## Runtime Boundary

The source graph keeps skills, agent profiles, instructions, concepts, and hooks as independent primitives. This `AGENTS.md` adapts bundled agent and instruction primitives into a plain instruction file for runtimes that do not expose those primitive kinds directly.

## Plugin Intent

Git and CI operations workflow for evidence-backed changes: goals, TDD, Git hygiene, PRs, GitHub Actions, releases, and shell-safe automation.

## Operating Rules

- Treat this file as an adapter, not a new source of truth.
- Use bundled skills for step-by-step workflows.
- Apply bundled instructions as normative guidance when their scope matches the task.
- Treat bundled agent profiles as review criteria or focused review passes.
- Keep hook behavior in bundled hook files and runtime adapter configs.
- When guidance conflicts with the target repository's nearest `AGENTS.md`, follow the target repository unless the user explicitly chooses this plugin's rule.
